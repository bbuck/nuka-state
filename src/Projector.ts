 * A projection function is a function that takes a set of atom values and

/**
 * The Projector is @nuka/state's equivalent to "computed" values. It takes one
 * or more input atom-like objects and a projection function and it sets it's
 * value based on the return of the projection function and all input atoms.
 * It will also subscribe to all the input atom-like objects so that if any of
 * their values are updated the projection function will run again.
 *
 * Projectors act like atoms, so they can be consumed by other projectors or
 * other atom-consuming API functions.
 *
 * There is a slight optimization that Projector will do, it will try and sniff
 * if any input atom-like objects are a ReadonlyAtom, and if so it will only
 * subscribe to them if there are subscribers to the Projector so that the
 * readonly atom isn't running when nothings is subscribed.
 *
 * #### NOTE
 *
 * Due to the fact that projectors subscribe to the atoms they are created
 * with, if you wish to stop using a projector (have it fall out of scope) you
 * must manually call `unsubscribeFromAtoms` or else the projector will not be
 * garbage collected as it's subscription function to all atoms will keep it in
 * memory. If the atoms that thep projector was created for/with will also fall
 * out of scope this is not required.
 *
 * ### Examples
 *
 * Probably the simpleist example of a projector is summing up multiple count
 * atoms.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const counter1 = atom(0);
 * const counter2 = atom(0);
 *
 * const display1 = document.getElementById('display-counter-1');
 * counter1.subscribe(count => {
 *   display1.textContent = `Current count: ${count.value}`;
 * });
 *
 * const incr1 = document.getElementById('increment-counter-1');
 * incr1.addEventListener('click', () => counter1.update(n => n + 1));
 *
 * const display2 = document.getElementById('display-counter-2');
 * counter2.subscribe(count => {
 *   display1.textContent = `Current count: ${count.value}`;
 * });
 *
 * const incr2 = document.getElementById('increment-counter-2');
 * incr2.addEventListener('click', () => counter2.update(n => n + 1));
 *
 * const sum = projector(counter1, counter2, (a, b) => a + b);
 *
 * const sumDisplay = document.getElementById('display-sum');
 * sum.subscribe(sum => {
 *   sumDisplay.textContent = `Total count: ${sum.value}`;
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Projectors don't always have to be used with multiple atoms, somtimes you
 * just want to be able to have and update data from a single atom in a
 * different way. Like showing the full name for a user.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const user = atom({
 *   firstName: 'Peter',
 *   lastName: 'Programmer',
 * });
 *
 * const fullName = projector(user, u => `${u.firstName} ${u.lastName}`);
 *
 * const firstNameInput = document.getElementById('first-name');
 * firstNameInput.addEventListener('input', event => {
 *   user.update(oldUser => ({ ...oldUser, firstName: event.target.value }));
 * });
 *
 * const lastNameInput = document.getElementById('last-name');
 * lastNameInput.addEventListener('input', event => {
 *   user.update(oldUser => ({ ...oldUser, lastName: event.target.value }));
 * });
 *
 * const fullNameDisplay = document.getElementById('full-name-display');
 * fullName.subscribe(name => {
 *   fullNameDisplay.textContent = name.value;
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * A simple and clean way to control how data is rendered, just modify `fullName`'s
 * projection function to, say, change the computed value to `last, first`
 * instead.
 *
 * @typeparam T The type of the projector's value.
 * @internal **DO NOT USE** Prefer using the [[projector]] factory function to
 *   manually creating instances of this class.
