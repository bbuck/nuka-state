/**
 * readonlyAtom will create a new ReadonlyAtom instance with the provided
 * initial value and start function. Readonly atoms are atoms that do not allow
 * users to set or modify values, just read; however, this does not mean their
 * value has to be static. If only an initialValue is provided then the returned
 * readonly atom will have a static value, however if you also pass in a start
 * function, this will receive a set function as an argument and from here you
 * can do whatever you might need, such as running a timeout or interval or
 * any other mechanism you need to periodically update the atoms value.
 *
 * ### Examples
 *
 * A really common example case is a clock:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const clock = readonlyAtom(new Date(), (set) => {
 *   set(new Date());
 *
 *   const interval = setInterval(() => {
 *     set(new Date());
 *   }, 1000);
 *
 *   return () => {
 *     clearInterval(interval);
 *   };
 * });
 *
 * const dateTimeDisplay = document.getElementById("date-time");
 *
 * clock.subscribe((atom) => {
 *   dateTimeDisplay.textContent = atom.value.toLocaleString();
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * See it on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/bbuck/pen/dyNBQev).
 *
 * Another possible example would be to handle other values set by something
 * else, such as the window scroll event, which can be throttled to prevent
 * unnecessary spam.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const scrollContainer = document.body;
 * const scrollTop = readonlyAtom(scrollContainer.scrollTop, (set) => {
 *   set(scrollContainer.scrollTop);
 *
 *   const onScroll = throttle(
 *     () => {
 *       set(scrollContainer.scrollTop);
 *     },
 *     200,
 *     true
 *   );
 *
 *   scrollContainer.addEventListener("scroll", onScroll);
 *
 *   () => {
 *     scrollContainer.removeEventListener("scroll", onScroll);
 *   };
 * });
 *
 * const display = document.getElementById("scroll-value");
 *
 * scrollTop.subscribe((atom) => {
 *   display.textContent = Math.round(atom.value);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * See it on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/bbuck/pen/wvgLQQY).
 *
 * @param initialValue The initial value of the ReadonlyAtom.
 * @param start The start function that should run if the ReadonlyAtom is live
 *   or has subscribers.
 * @returns The ReadonlyAtom instance that can be used as readonly storage.
 * @typeparam T The type of the atom's value.

/**
 * The atom is the core of @nuka/sate. It represents a piece of data that can
 * be set or udpated anywhere in an application and provides the capability
 * for a user to subscribe and listen for the changes. This allows your data to
 * be used in a variety of places around your application while also allowing
 * the consumers that need to respond to changes the capability of knowing when
 * the value has been modified. Examples can range from user authentication
 * tokens, application objects, counts, or any other data where you may need
 * access to it in more than one place but wish to be notified when it's value
 * has changed.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const counter = atom(0);
 *
 * const countDisplay = document.getElementById("display-counter");
 * counter.subscribe((atom) => {
 *   countDisplay.textContent = `Current count: ${atom.value}`;
 * });
 *
 * const incrementButton = document.getElementById("increment-counter");
 * incrementButton.addEventListener("click", () => counter.update((n) => n + 1));
 * ```
 *
 * See it on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/bbuck/pen/yLgwBGL).
 *
 * @param value The initial value of the atom.
 * @returns A new atom containing the initial value ready for use.
 * @typeparam T The type of the atom's value.

/**
 * Create a new projector, which will take in atom-like objects as input and
 * a function that combines their values into a new value. Commonly this is
 * referred to as a "computed value." Projectors can be used to many purposes,
 * if the new data is just a unique combination of existing values then it's
 * better to use a Projector which will automatically subscribe to the passed in
 * atom-like objects and update when they update. Coordinating this without a
 * projector is possible but why go through all that extra work?
 *
 * #### NOTE
 *
 * Since ReadonlyAtom's don't "start" when they don't have subscribers, Projector
 * tries to play smart and mimic this. If it detects that it received a
 * ReadonlyAtom as an input atom it will not subscribe to it unless the Projector
 * itself has a subscriber. If the ReadonlyAtom is live and running then the
 * Projector will be out of sync with it's current value. To fix this, provide
 * a no-op subscriber to the projector or subscribe to it to receive reactive
 * updates.
 *
 * ### Examples
 *
 * Probably the simpleist example of a projector is summing up multiple count
 * atoms.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const counter1 = atom(0);
 * const counter2 = atom(0);
 *
 * const display1 = document.getElementById("display-counter-1");
 * counter1.subscribe((count) => {
 *   display1.textContent = `Current count: ${count.value}`;
 * });
 *
 * const incr1 = document.getElementById("increment-counter-1");
 * incr1.addEventListener("click", () => counter1.update((n) => n + 1));
 *
 * const display2 = document.getElementById("display-counter-2");
 * counter2.subscribe((count) => {
 *   display2.textContent = `Current count: ${count.value}`;
 * });
 *
 * const incr2 = document.getElementById("increment-counter-2");
 * incr2.addEventListener("click", () => counter2.update((n) => n + 1));
 *
 * const sum = projector(counter1, counter2, (a, b) => a + b);
 *
 * const sumDisplay = document.getElementById("display-sum");
 * sum.subscribe((sum) => {
 *   sumDisplay.textContent = `Total count: ${sum.value}`;
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * See it on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/bbuck/pen/QWdeMpe).
 *
 * Projectors don't always have to be used with multiple atoms, somtimes you
 * just want to be able to have and update data from a single atom in a
 * different way. Like showing the full name for a user.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const user = atom({
 *   firstName: 'Peter',
 *   lastName: 'Programmer',
 * });
 *
 * const fullName = projector(user, u => `${u.firstName} ${u.lastName}`);
 *
 * const firstNameInput = document.getElementById('first-name');
 * firstNameInput.value = user.value.firstName;
 * firstNameInput.addEventListener('input', event => {
 *   user.update(oldUser => ({ ...oldUser, firstName: event.target.value }));
 * });
 *
 * const lastNameInput = document.getElementById('last-name');
 * lastNameInput.value = user.value.lastName;
 * lastNameInput.addEventListener('input', event => {
 *   user.update(oldUser => ({ ...oldUser, lastName: event.target.value }));
 * });
 *
 * const fullNameDisplay = document.getElementById('display-full-name');
 * fullNameDisplay.textContent = fullName.value;
 * fullName.subscribe(name => {
 *   fullNameDisplay.textContent = name.value;
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * See it on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/bbuck/pen/gOgVxXQ)
 *
 * A simple and clean way to control how data is rendered, just modify `fullName`'s

/**
 * A Reactor is a specialized [[Atom]] wrapper that behaves similar to an atom but
 * provides pre-defined and pre-bound functions for interacting with a an atom.
 * This is useful if you have an atom and you wish to provide a specialized
 * interface on top of `update` that allows a client to react to the event or
 * extract them for later use.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * For example, here is the Atom counter example redefined to use the reactor.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const counter = reactor(atom(0), {
 *   increment: value => value + 1,
 * });
 *
 * const countDisplay = document.querySelector('#count-display');
 * counter.subscribe(atom => {
 *   countDisplay.textContent = `Current count: ${atom.value}`;
 * });
 *
 * const incrementButton = document.querySelector('#increment-button');
 * const incr = counter.extract('increment');
 * incrementButton.addEventListener('click', incr);
 * ```
 *
 * See it on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/bbuck/pen/OJpypKx).
 *
 * @typeparam T The type of the wrapped atom's value.
 * @typeparam R The ReactionMutationMapping provided to the Reactor.
 * @internal **DO NOT USE** Prefer the [[reactor]] factory function to manually
 *   creating instances of this class.
