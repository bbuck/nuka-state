 * cleanup any intervals or timeouts, etc... that the start function created.
 * This stop function is called when the last subscriber unsubscribes from the
 * [[ReadonlyAtom]] so that anything that is running is only going to run while
 * being listened to.
 *
 * It's good practice to always seed with an updated value (if applicable) when
 * the start function is called, for example consider this [[ReadonlyAtom]] that
 * represents the current time:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const clock = readonlyAtom(new Date().toLocaleString(), set => {
 *   set(new Date().toLocaleString());
 *
 *   const interval = setInterval(() => {
 *     set(new Date().toLocaleString());
 *   }, 1000);
 *
 *   return () => {
 *     clearInterval(interval);
 *   };
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Despite providing an initial value we also set an updated value as the first
 * line in the start function so that after a period of no subscribers we can
 * ensure that we have an updated value instead of a stale value. This does not
 * apply to all use cases though, in some cases there may not be an updated
 * value you can set, perhaps if you're [[ReadonlyAtom]] is representing the current
 * user or something that would require a network request for fresh data.
 * @typeparam T The type of the atom's value.

/**
 * ReadonlyAtom is a specialized atom that does not provide any public method
 * for setting their values. This means they do not have an `update` or `set`
 * function that can be called by other code and can only be read via `value`;
 * however, this does not mean that their value cannot be modified after they
 * are created.
 *
 * There are two ways to use ReadonlyAtom's, the first of which is as a normal
 * atom with a value that will never change. You can do this by using the
 * [[readonlyAtom]] function and passing in just it's first argument:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const ten = readonlyAtom(10);
 * ```
 *
 * In this example `ten` will always hold the value `10`, since we did not pass
 * a start function that would receive the setter we can be assured that it's
 * value is static for the lifetime of the atom. While it is still possible to
 * subscribe to these static atoms, they are essentially no-op, since there
 * would be no way for the atom's value to change subscribe requests are
 * ignored.
 *
 * The other, and maybe more useful, method of using a ReadonlyAtom is one that
 * receives a start function in addition to the intitial value that allows it's
 * value to be updated in response to something. These kinds of ReadonlyAtoms
 * are created by providing a start function as the second argument to
 * [[readonlyAtom]], a smiple example would be an atom that acts like a clock:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const clock = readonlyAtom(new Date(), set => {
 *   set(new Date());
 *
 *   const interval = setInterval(() => {
 *     set(new Date());
 *   }, 1000);
 *
 *   return () => {
 *     clearInterval(interval);
 *   };
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * In the above example we create a ReadonlyAtom that will have it's value
 * updated ever second via an interval. We do this by passing in a start
 * function which receives one argument, `set` which lets you set the value of
 * the atom and should return a stop function to clean up any intervals or
 * timeouts or anything else that should be stopped.
 *
 * Since the value will change we can subscribe to listen for the value updates
 * like any other atom. And subscription is key for these atoms. For efficiency
 * sake the start function will not be called until there is at least one
 * subscriber on the atom and it will be halted when the last subscriber
 * unsubscribes. This is why you would typically want to update the value at
 * the beginning of your start function so that subscribers can read and use
 * the latest values.
 *
 * If you do need your readonly atom to run even without subscribers you can
 * use `setLive` to switch it to a live atom which means that it will call the
 * start function and will not call stop regardless of how many subscribers it
 * has. This should be used sparingly because any resources will be constantly
 * running, it's better to try and work in using the subscribe functions for the
 * lifetime you use the atom instead of having it constatly live.
 * @typeparam T The type of the atom's value.
 * @internal **DO NOT USE** Prefer using the [[readonlyAtom]] factory function
 *   to manually creating instances of this class.
